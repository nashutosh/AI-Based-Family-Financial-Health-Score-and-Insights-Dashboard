Usage
#
FastAPI (API for Predictions)
Start the FastAPI server in the app/ directory:
bash
 
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
The API documentation is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
Utilize the /predict endpoint for financial health score predictions:
 
Request Body Example:
json
Copy code
{
  "Income": 5000,
  "Savings": 1000,
  "Loan_Payments": 300,
  "Credit_Card_Spending": 200,
"Dependents": 2,
 "Financial_Goals_Met": 70
}
Example of the response
json
Copy code
{
  "Financial Health Score": 85.0,
  "Recommendations": [
    "Save at least 20% of income."
  ]
}
Streamlit Dashboard
In streamlit_app/ directory:
Run the dashboard:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.
Enter financial data to get scores and recommendations.

Score Logic

The financial health score is calculated as follows:
python
Copy code
score = (
Savings_to_Income_Ratio * 40 +
    (1 - Expenses_to_Income_Ratio) * 30 +
    (1 - Loan_to_Income_Ratio) * 20 +
    Financial_Goals_Met * 10
).clip(0, 100)
Weights Explanation:
Savings (40%): Encourages long-term stability.
Expenses (30%): Lower expenses improve financial health.
Loan Payments (20%): Reducing debt contributes positively.
Financial Goals Met (10%): Reflects progress toward targets.
Recommendations
Based on your financial score, the system provides actionable insights:
Low Savings: "Increase savings to at least 20% of income."

High Expenses: "Reduce expenses below 70% of income."

Low Goal Achievement: "Focus on achieving at least 50% of your financial goals."

Visualizations
